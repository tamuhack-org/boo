[TAMUhack](https://tamuhack.org) is a student-led organization that hosts two hackathons at Texas A&M University:
- HowdyHack, our smaller (~400 participants) Fall hackathon meant for A&M students only.
- TAMUhack, our flagship (~800 participants) Spring hackathon open to highschool and college students around the world.

TAMUhack has been around since 2013 and we've learned a lot about how to successfully run a hackathon.
From mentor queues to judging software, we'll walk you through how we do things.

These docs serve as a showcase and guide for the open-source software we use to run our events.
