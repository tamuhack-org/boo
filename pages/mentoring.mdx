# Overview 

Mentoring is a huge part of hackathons! At TAMUhack, we have 40-50 mentors that tend to any questions
that the hackers may have. We send out a mentor application to students/professors and schedule them for 2 hour shifts
throughout the day.

Allowing access to mentors pushes your hackathon to the next level and makes it a more enjoyable experience for the hackers,
especially beginners.
