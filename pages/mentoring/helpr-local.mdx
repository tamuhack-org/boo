# Running HelpR Locally 

## Getting Started

Getting HelpR up and running locally is pretty easy!

First, clone/fork [the repo](https://github.com/tamuhack-org/helpr) and install the dependencies: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tamuhack-org/helpr.git
$ cd helpr 
$ npm i 
``` 

Then, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following: 

```bash filename=".env" copy
NEXT_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/auth"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
DATABASE_PRISMA_URL=
```

See more information about these variables below. 

Finally, run the development server: 

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables 

#### NEXT_URL
Obtained by using the URL of the locally hosted site,
appended with `/api/auth`. Learn more from the [NextAuth Docs.](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options)\
Example: `NEXT_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/auth"`

#### NEXTAUTH_SECRET
A random string used to hash tokens, sign/encrypt cookies and generate cryptographic keys. 
Learn more from the [NextAuth Docs.](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options)

Generate with openssl in the terminal: 
```bash
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```

Example: `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=aBh15h3KSq/I5tH3C00135t/CY6UMGun=`

#### GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

Follow these steps to obtain this information:
1. Create a new Google Cloud Project.
2. Create credentials for a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
3. Set the Application Type as Web Application and choose any name.
4. Add `http://localhost:3000` as an Authorized JavaScript origin.
5. Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` as an Authorized redirect URI.
6. Save the configuration. Once created, you can view the Client ID and Client Secret.


<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
For deploying the app, simply add new authorized Javascript origins and redirect URIs,
switching out `localhost:3000` with the canonical URL of the deployment.
</Callout>

#### GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

Follow the above steps ðŸ‘†

#### DATABASE_PRISMA_URL

The PostgreSQL database URL. A PostgreSQL database can be hosted on many platforms, including Heroku, AWS, and Vercel.
We recommend Vercel because it's free and easy to set up.

Example: `DATABASE_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/helpr?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=15"`
